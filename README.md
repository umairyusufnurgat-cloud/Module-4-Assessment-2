🧩 Ode to the JigSaw King
In Lusaka’s light, a coder rose, With puzzle pieces lined in rows. He dragged and dropped with perfect flair, Each donkey ear placed with care.

The grid stood proud, though off to the side, “Center it!” Umair cried. He tweaked the code, committed fast, And watched his layout shine at last.

Accessories danced, the music played, A masterpiece that he had made. From PNGs to README flair, No bug too big for Umair to bear.

So if the grid had dared to stray, He’d fix it all without delay. And if the code had failed to bend, He’d make Copilot rhyme again. 😅
